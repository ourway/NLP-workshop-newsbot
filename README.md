Rasa has two main parts:
-    NLU: Natural Language Understanding: nlu.md
-    CORE: Dialog management and response: stories.md, domain.yml, config.yml, actions.py

## Building a chatbox:
    1) Having a sample conversation
    2) Create intents with sample training data to build a ground for our chat box
    3) Specify entities
    4) Specify a training algorithm
    5) Train the model and test the output
    6) Add sample stories (The path your customer might choose to start and maintain the
    conversation)
    7) Add slots (or entities to remember during the conversation)
    8) Create responses
    9) Implement Actions
    10) Refine

## The Goal:
    A) For data scientists to understand how Rasa works and find best methods to get better results
    B) For engineers: to understand how Rasa works and design better solutions
